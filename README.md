## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I think my biggest learning on this project was that margins collapse, I still don't quite understand why, I used flexbox to correct this behavior, I also had to use min-height property to control the size of the QR container.

### Continued development

I still need to learn and practice more CSS, this is what will enable me to become a proper full stack developer.

### Useful resources

- [Collapsing margins by W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/box.html#collapsing-margins)
- [Collapsing margins by sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/collapsing-margins/)

These two articles helped me understand a little bit why this happens, still, more learning needs to be done.
